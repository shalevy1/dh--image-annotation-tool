# Image annotation tool

Image annotation tool is a web application that allows users to map znoes of interest in an image. These zones are then converted to pre-made code snippet that can be used in a TEI P5 document to
connect the image to the text.



## Usage
Visit [the app website](http://www.david-schwartz.org/image-annotation-tool/), open your image and start annotating.
The app can be installed as PWA (Progressive Web App).

## Development
All contributions are welcomed. The app is written in [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and uses [React Draggable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draggable) for dragging tool panes.

### Installation

npm install
npm start
